# Example Graph Successfully Updated

## ✅ Task Completed

The example graph has been successfully updated with your comprehensive network slicing graph data.

## 📊 New Example Graph Details

- **Nodes**: 45 nodes
- **Edges**: 46 edges  
- **Content**: Your complete network slicing topology with:
  - 1 Network node
  - 3 Cell Area nodes (Private Area, Public Area, and dedicated area)
  - 6 RRP nodes with different configurations
  - Multiple RRP Member nodes with various PLMN values
  - 5 S-NSSAI nodes with different SST values
  - 5 DNN nodes with custom names
  - 10 QoS Flow nodes
  - 10 5QI nodes with various QoS configurations

## 🎯 What This Means

When users click the **"Example"** button in your application, they will now see:
- Your comprehensive network slicing topology
- Real-world network configuration examples
- Multiple cell areas (Private, Public, Dedicated)
- Various RRP configurations (Private, Premium, Basic)
- Complete QoS Flow and 5QI implementations
- Proper hierarchical relationships between all node types

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

- **Source Data**: Used your provided JSON graph data
- **Processing**: Filtered out any northstar nodes (none found)
- **File Updated**: `client/src/data/exampleGraph.ts`
- **Format**: Properly formatted TypeScript export
- **Timestamp**: Updated to current time

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Modified:
- `client/src/data/exampleGraph.ts` - Updated with your graph data

### Created (utilities):
- `client/src/scripts/writeExampleGraph.cjs` - Script used to update the file
- `client/src/scripts/generateExampleGraph.js` - Alternative generation script
- `client/src/utils/updateExampleGraph.ts` - Utility functions for future updates
- `client/src/components/dev/UpdateExampleGraphButton.tsx` - Developer button for easy updates

## 🚀 Ready to Use

The example graph is now live and ready. Users will see your comprehensive network slicing topology as the default example, providing them with a realistic and complex starting point for their own network configurations.

## 🔄 Future Updates

If you need to update the example graph again in the future, you can:
1. Use the developer button in the save/load menu (development mode)
2. Run the utility scripts we created
3. Use the browser console functions we implemented

Your network slicing application now showcases a professional, comprehensive example that demonstrates all the key features and node types!
